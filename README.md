# Power_BI_Dashboard
Microsoftâ€™s Power BI is a business and data analytics service that enables professionals to process, analyze, and visualize vast volumes of data. 
It helps extract insights, draw conclusions, and share results in the form of reports and dashboards across various departments. 
It provides an easy drag and drops feature with a range of interactive data visualizations to generate reports and dashboards.
A Power BI dashboard is a single page that tells a story through visualizations. 
Because it's limited to one page, a well-designed dashboard contains only the highlights of that story.
Dashboards are a way to monitor your business and see all your most important metrics at a glance.
Here, I have created a dashboard using the sales data.
